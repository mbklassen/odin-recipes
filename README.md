The Odin Project - Project #1: Recipes

This is the first project completed as part of The Odin Project cirriculum. It showcases my knowledge of basic HTML and Git, and is comprised of a homepage which links to a recipe page. Some of the HTML skills needed to make this website include creating a boilerplate, creating ordered and unordered lists, embedding pictures and hyperlinks, and formatting text into paragrahs and headings. In addition to HTML, I must know how to make Git and GitHub repositories and have a knowledge of the most common Git commands.
